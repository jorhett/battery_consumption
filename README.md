This component is used to compute statistics on a battery (based on its level state)

This component allows to :
- to display the current varation of battery
- the charge in % or in Wh/kWh...
- the discharge in % or in Wh/kWh ...
- the total charge/discharge

The refresh rate is based on battery's level state

## Installation
Either use HACS (default), either manual
### [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store)   {REQUEST ON PROCESS}
1. Go to HACS page on your Home Assistant instance 
1. Select `integration` 
1. Press add icon and search for `battery_consumption` 
1. Select battery_consumption and install 

### Manual
<details><summary>Manual Procedure</summary>
  
1. Download the folder battery_consumption from the latest [release](https://github.com/jugla/battery_consumption/releases) (with right click, save 
link as) 
1. Place the downloaded directory on your Home Assistant machine in the `config/custom_components` folder (when there is no `custom_components` folder in the 
folder where your `configuration.yaml` file is, create it and place the directory there) 
1. restart HomeAssistant

## Using the component
in configuration.yaml, declare :

```yaml
##configuration.yaml example
battery_consumption:
    zoe:
       source: sensor.battery_level
       unit_of_measurement: kWh
       battery_capacity: 41
#      unique_id : to set a unique id to this sensor
#      attribute : attribute of source to monitor
#      precision : the precision of state
    galaxy_s7:
       source: sensor.sm_g930f_niveau_de_batterie
       unit_of_measurement: Wh
       battery_capacity: 11.55

``` 
where :
- source is name of the state to monitor
- attribute is the attribute of source to monitor
- unique_id is to set a unique id to this sensor
- precision is the precision you set (default 2)
- battery_capacity is the capacity of the monitored battery
- unit_of_measurement is the unit of capacity : kWh, Wh, ...

Only source is required

</details>

## Sensor and attribute
For each battery to monitor one sensor is created.
The sensor state reprensents the current value of battery to minitor.

The sensor is created with the following attribute :

|Â Attribute name | support | present | Description |
| ---------------|---------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| Source | V1.0.0 | always | the name of battery to monitor | 
| Previous value | V1.0.0 |  always | the previous value of battery to monitor |
| Variation | V1.0.0 |  always | the difference between current and previous value |
| Battery charge | V1.0.0 |  always | the difference between current and previous value if positive (battery is charging) |
| Battery discharge | V1.0.0 |  always | the difference between current and previous value if negative (battery is discharging) |
| Total charge | V1.0.0 |  always | the sum of all *battery charge* since the beginning | 
| Total discharge | V1.0.0 |  always | the sum of all *battery discharge* since the beginning |
| Capacity | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the capacity of the battery cf. yaml |
| Capacity unit | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the unif of the capacity of the battery cf. yaml |
| Energy charge | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the *battery charge* convert in energy |
| Energy discharge | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the *battery discharge* convert in energy |
| Total energy charge | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the *total battery charge* convert in energy |
| Total energy discharge | V1.0.0 |  if capacity given | the *total battery discharge* convert in energy |

## Typical use
Typical use is to follow the consumption of battery thanks to utility meter

```yaml
##configuration.yaml example
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: zoe_batterie_total_charge
        state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.battery_consumption_sensor_battery_level', 'total_energy_charge') }}"
        unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
        device_class: energy
        state_class: measurement

  - sensor:
      - name: zoe_batterie_total_discharge
        state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.battery_consumption_sensor_battery_level', 'total_energy_discharge') }}"
        unit_of_measurement: 'kWh'
        device_class: energy
        state_class: measurement

## UTILITY METER
utility_meter:
  zoe_batterie_total_charge_daily:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_charge
   cycle : daily
  zoe_batterie_total_charge_weekly:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_charge
   cycle : weekly
  zoe_batterie_total_charge_monthly:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_charge
   cycle : monthly

  zoe_batterie_total_discharge_daily:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_discharge
   cycle : daily
  zoe_batterie_total_discharge_weekly:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_discharge
   cycle : weekly
  zoe_batterie_total_discharge_monthly:
   source: sensor.zoe_batterie_total_discharge
   cycle : monthly
``` 

Another typical use is to follow the variation of battery in statistics graph .
```yaml
##configuration.yaml example
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: zoe_batterie_variation
        state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.battery_consumption_sensor_battery_level', 'variation') }}"
        unit_of_measurement: '%'
        device_class: battery
        state_class: measurement
```
